# Vertex AI Model Fine-Tuning

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune pre-trained models using Vertex AI, Google Cloud's machine learning platform. Fine-tuning allows you to adapt a general-purpose model to a specific task or dataset, often resulting in improved performance compared to using the pre-trained model directly.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Google Cloud Account:** You need a Google Cloud account with billing enabled.
2.  **Vertex AI API Enabled:** Enable the Vertex AI API in your Google Cloud project.
3.  **Google Cloud SDK (gcloud):** Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK.


## Setup


1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Fine-Tuning Process

The fine-tuning process typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Prepare your dataset in a format suitable for Vertex AI. This might involve uploading your data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
2.  **Model Selection:** Choose a pre-trained model from the Vertex AI Model Registry or use a custom model.
3.  **Fine-Tuning Job Configuration:** Configure the fine-tuning job, specifying parameters such as the training dataset, validation dataset, learning rate, and number of training steps.
4.  **Job Submission:** Submit the fine-tuning job to Vertex AI.
5.  **Monitoring:** Monitor the job's progress using the Google Cloud Console or the Vertex AI API.
6.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the fine-tuned model using appropriate metrics.
7.  **Model Deployment:** Deploy the fine-tuned model to an endpoint for online prediction or use it for batch prediction.
